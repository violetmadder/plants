Acknowledgments
The author, Mr. Greg de Nevers, would like to thank George Lindsay for having the
vision to see this project started and the commitment to see it finished. Thanks to Tom
Howell for enduring unending interruptions with the same question—―Tom, do you
recognize this plant?‖—and for identifying Carex specimens. Mr. de Nevers thanks all
the people at the Botany Department of the California Academy of Sciences for their
support, encouragement, and material aid. Thanks to Mary Susan Taylor for her
suggestions and for typing the original manuscript. Thanks to Dan Warrick for carefully
editing the original manuscript. Thanks to Michael Gillogly for coordinating the
production of the second edition, including digitizing the manuscript, entering additions,
and changing names to conform to The Jepson Manual (Hickman 1993). Thanks to Gary
Hundt for producing the index. Thanks to Ann Howald for many helpful corrections and
suggestions. Lastly, Mr. de Nevers would like to thank Maggie and David Cavagnaro
who helped him get started with flowers by handing him a dissecting scope and a copy of
Munz and Keck (1958) instead of telling him the names of plants.
2013 Editor Revisions
The publication of the Pepperwood vascular flora, 3
rd edition, was primarily spurred
by the arrival of The Jepson Manual, Second Edition (Baldwin et al. 2012), which
included extensive taxonomic revisions and additions to the California Flora. It was the
goal of the editors to conserve the botanical and natural history information included in
the previous flora editions. The current edition has been revised to reflect updated place
name information, to include species that have been observed since 2006 and only those
that are found on the preserve. A preserve map with place names is included on page v.
Included in the back of the flora are appendices listing cultivated taxa associated with the
preserve homestead sites (Appendix A), a brief reference to plants found on neighboring
properties originally included in the flora (Appendix B), and a list of invasive and
noxious weeds found on the preserve (Appendix C).

Pepperwood Flora: Introduction 1
Introduction
Pepperwood is a community-supported ecological institute that conducts applied
research and provides educational programming with the singular goal of conserving the
Bay Area’s natural heritage for generations to come. Dedicated to the protection of the
region’s rich biodiversity represented within its 3,117 acres, Pepperwood provides unique
open-space opportunities to nature lovers, volunteers, students of all ages and scientific
researchers. Our mission is to advance science-based conservation throughout our region
and beyond.
The land that comprises Pepperwood Preserve was donated to the California
Academy of Sciences as a preserve in 1979 by Kenneth K. and Nancy Bechtel. In 2005
the Pepperwood Foundation (a 501(c)3 public charity) was established by Jane and Herb
Dwight to assume stewardship of the preserve from the Academy. The Pepperwood
Foundation hosts on-site programs to enhance the biological diversity of the preserve and
to promote natural science education and research. This has been made possible, in part,
through the construction and opening of the Dwight Center for Conservation Science in
2010, the dedication of the Stephen J. Barnhart Herbarium in 2012, and through the
etablishment of the Stephen J. Barnhart Internship fund in 2012 which supports Santa
Rosa Junior College students conducting ecological research at the preserve.
Pepperwood is situated in the Mayacamas Range of California’s Inner Coast Ranges,
northeast of the city of Santa Rosa. The preserve is approximately 25 miles from the
coast by air, and is near the eastern extreme of coastal fog penetration. On many summer
days, fog comes east up either the Russian River Valley, or through the Petaluma Gap,
then north to fill the Santa Rosa Valley, but fails to reach Pepperwood. When fog does
reach Pepperwood it most commonly arrives through these two western avenues. On rare
days, fog that blows through the Golden Gate continues up the Napa Valley and
approaches Pepperwood from the east.
Pepperwood experiences a Mediterranean climate, with a cool wet season from
November to March, and a hot dry season from April to October. Important
consequences of Mediterranean climate for plants are: germination of annuals in
November and December; growth of herbaceous perennials beginning in December; and
seed set in May to June, followed by dormancy through November. Additionally, many
trees and shrubs have hard, waxy leaves to resist summer drought. Streams are typically
intermittent at Pepperwood, with high flows from January to March, and little surface
water from June to November.
Pepperwood Preserve’s geographic location near the boundaries of the California
Floristic Province Inner North Coast Ranges (NCoRI) and Outer North Coast Ranges
(NCoRO) subregions (Baldwin et al. 2012) is evident in the preserve’s floristic diversity.
The preserve is also geographically situated at the north-south and east-west range
boundaries of multiple taxa. Combined with its intricate combinations of topography,
microclimate and edaphic variation, and its close proximity to urban areas, Pepperwood
Preserve is a unique place for promoting habitat conservation, scientific research and
community education.
2 Pepperwood Flora: Plant Communities
Plant Communities
Pepperwood’s plant communities are an expression of the various species’ genetic
requirements and tolerances interacting with the local environment. Climate, geology,
and interaction with local animals, notably people, influence the local and regional
distribution of plants. To accurately document plant species distributions and classify the
vegetation communities that occur on the preserve, Pepperwood research staff conducted
a vegetation survey in 2012 using a modified version of the California Native Plant
Society’s rapid assessment protocols. Vegetation alliances were assigned according to A
Manual of California Vegetation, Second Edition (CNPS MCV) (Sawyer et al. 2009) and
mapped using ArcGIS. CNPS MCV vegetation alliances documented on the preserve
include: Douglas-fir forest, Redwood forest, Madrone forest, Tanoak forest, California
bay forest, California black oak forest, Coast live oak woodland, Blue oak woodland,
Valley oak woodland, Oregon white oak woodland, Mixed oak forest, Chamise chaparral,
Wedge leaf ceanothus chaparral, Coyote brush scrub, Leather oak chaparral, Wild oats
grasslands, California oat grass prairie, Annual dogtail grasslands, Purple needle grass
grassland, and Harding grass swards. Provisional alliances were assigned to a subset of
vegetation communities that are not contained in the CNPS MCV, but are common plant
assemblages at Pepperwood including: Douglas-fir/Mixed hardwood forest, Riparian
woodland, Mixed manzanita chaparral, Mixed chaparral, Annual non-native grassland,
Medusahead grassland, and Mixed rush wetland.
The plant communities described below represent major classifications that are
divided first on the basis of stature (physiognomy), secondly on that of the 2012
vegetation alliances, and third on that of flora. Plants with an asterisk following the Latin
name occur infrequently at Pepperwood, usually only in one locality, and are noted as an
item of interest occurring within the community.
Pepperwood Flora: Plant Communities 3
Douglas-fir Forest
Douglas-fir forest is dominated by cone-bearing trees (conifers), specifically
Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii). This vegetation community occurs
primarily on north-facing slopes, but sometimes continues around hills to east- and westfacing
slopes and ridgetops. The shrubby and herbaceous understory is sparse. Stands of
mature Douglas-fir forest occur at Grouse Hill, northwest of the Dwight Center, between
Redwood and Weimar Canyons, in Piney Canyon, east of Murry’s Gate, on the northern
ridge of Rogers Canyon, and in Garrison Canyon.
Vegetation alliances in Sawyer et al. (2009) that are representative of the Douglas-fir
forest plant community at Pepperwood include:
 Pseudotsuga menziesii Forest Alliance (Douglas-fir forest)
Plants characteristic of Douglas-fir forest at Pepperwood are:
Trees Herbs
Pinus ponderosa Anisocarpus madioides
Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii Dryopteris arguta
Umbellularia californica Hieracium albiflorum
Melica californica
Shrubs and Vines Pentagramma triangularis subsp. triangularis
Rosa gymnocarpa var. gymnocarpa Polystichum californicum
Symphoricarpos mollis
Toxicodendron diversilobum
Redwood Forest
At Pepperwood, the occurrence of coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) is rather
limited, presumably due to summer aridity and limited suitable environmental conditions
that support redwood forest communities. Redwood trees and associated herbs in the
redwood forest depend on fog-borne moisture in summer and occur in pockets of deep
shade and at the sites of perennial springs and streams. Except for occasional stands of
isolated trees along the eastern preserve boundary, the only development of redwood
forest at Pepperwood is at Redwood Canyon. Tanbark oak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus
var. densiflorus) and California nutmeg (Torreya californica) occur in this enclave, as
does trail plant (Adenocaulon bicolor). This community is largely a floristic variation of
the Douglas-fir forest, being physiognomically similar: the redwood forest understory is
sparse.
All but a few gnarled individual redwoods at Pepperwood were felled between 1880
and 1930 as part of a local microeconomy. They were cut and split for fence posts, rails,
grape stakes and lumber and were sold to the families who grew grapes in the preserve
uplands. Wood from these trees rarely went further than ten miles to its use site. The trail
used to haul lumber up from Redwood Canyon to Hill 1524 is still traceable through
Redwood Canyon. One occasionally finds grape stakes in the meadows between High 
4 Pepperwood Flora: Plant Communities
Hill and Hill 1524 where freestanding, head-pruned zinfandel grapes once grew.
Redwood Canyon is the only place turret spiders are found at Pepperwood, and summer
is defined by the nasal honk of the red-breasted nuthatch in the redwood trees.
Vegetation alliances in Sawyer et al. (2009) that are representative of the Redwood forest
plant community at Pepperwood include:
 Sequoia sempervirens Forest Alliance (Redwood forest)
Plants characteristic of redwood forest at Pepperwood are:
Trees Herbs

Sequoia sempervirens Prosartes hookeri
Torreya californica Trientalis latifolia
Umbellularia californica Trillium albidum
Vancouveria planipetala
Vines
Toxicodendron diversilobum
Whipplea modesta*
Mixed Hardwood Forest
Mixed hardwood forest is prevalent across the preserve and is composed of many
combinations of hardwood tree species including: oaks (Quercus spp. ), madrone
(Arubutus menziesii), tanbark oak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus var. densiflorus),
California buckeye (Aesculus californica), big-leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), and
California bay laurel (Umbellularia californica). Douglas-fir trees are often present,
either in the understory or scattered throughout the canopy. Evidence of succession is
captured in the canopy substructure with shrubs of manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.) or
chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum var. fasciculatum) often found dead or struggling to
survive under the shaded overstory.
Stands dominated by a single hardwood species, aside from Quercus, are included in
the mixed hardwood forest classification. Madrone forests are found in the northwestern
arm of the preserve near Hendley Flat and Martin Creek, and north of the fork in the road
to Weimar Falls and Weimar Flat. A large stand of tanbark oak is present in Devil’s
Kitchen, northeast of Grouse Hill. Forest dominated by California bay laurel line the
drainages west of the Bechtel House and north of the Goodman Homestead, but the
largest California bay forest on the preserve occurs at the Strebel Homestead.
Vegetation alliances in Sawyer et al. (2009) that are representative of the mixed
hardwood forest plant community at Pepperwood include:
 Arbutus menziesii Forest Alliance (Madrone forest)
 Notholithocarpus densiflorus Forest Alliance (Tanoak forest)
 Umbellularia californica Forest Alliance (California bay forest)

Oak Woodland
The oak woodland community at Pepperwood includes both evergreen and deciduous
oaks; small shrub oaks and huge trees; oaks that grow in the hottest and driest habitats;
and oaks that stand in water for months at Turtle Pond. Oak woodlands range from dense
to open canopies. These woodlands have a rich and diverse shrubby and herbaceous
understory, harboring a great variety of native herbs that are largely perennial. The acorns
produced in these communities are an important food resource for many animals and
birds.
Five oak species share dominance in the oak woodlands at Pepperwood, each species
sorting out moisture and temperature gradients. Hot, south-facing slopes are often
dominated by the evergreen coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia var. agrifolia). On cooler
north-facing slopes, deciduous Oregon oak (Q. garrayana var. garryana) is commonly
preponderant. Blue oak (Q. douglasii) and black oak (Q. kelloggii) often dominate eastand
west-facing slopes and valley bottoms, although never so thoroughly as do the northand
south-facing slope oak species. Valley oak (Quercus lobata) is sparsely scattered
throughout the preserve on deep soils of flats at all elevations.
Oak woodland communities provide a variety of habitats for other plants, including
deep shade, light shade, sunny openings between widely spaced trees, seasonal shade
below deciduous trees, and branches where epiphytic lichens, mosses, and the
hemiparasitic mistletoe (Phoradendron serotinum subsp. tomentosum) perch.
Oak woodlands are the home of a beautiful grass formation; dense stands of
California fescue (Festuca californica) occur as an understory to Oregon oaks on northfacing
slopes. This formation is a great aid in imagining what California looked like
before the introduction of Eurasian annual grasses and grazing mammals. Fescue bunch 
6 Pepperwood Flora: Plant Communities
grasses can grow up to 2-3 feet in diameter and are best seen in Garrison Canyon, on the
north slope of Horse Hill, and along the road to Redwood Canyon.
Oaks are monoecious (separate male and female flowers on the same plant), the male
flowers in long strings (catkins) and the female flowers solitary or in small groups in the
leaf axils and not readily apparent. The white oak group (Oregon, valley, blue, and scrub
oak) hybridizes regularly, with crosses between all pairs producing fertile hybrids. Trees
exhibiting characters of blue, Oregon and valley oaks are common, and trees with
introgression of all four species may exist west of Goodman Homestead. Sterile hybrids
also occur between coast and interior live oaks and California black oak.
Vegetation alliances in Sawyer et al. (2009) that are representative of the oak woodland
plant community at Pepperwood include:
 Quercus agrifolia Woodland Alliance (Coast live oak woodland)
 Quercus douglasii Woodland Alliance (Blue oak woodland)
 Quercus garryana Woodland Alliance (Oregon white oak woodland)
 Quercus kelloggii Forest Alliance (California black oak forest)
 Quercus lobata Wooldand Alliance (Valley oak woodland)

Riparian Woodland
Covering the banks of the largest streams in the vicinity of Pepperwood is a plant
association determined by the availability of summer water: deciduous riparian
woodland dominated by bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), white alder (Alnus
rhombifolia), and willow (Salix spp.). There are no perennial streams on Pepperwood;
however, Rogers Creek and tributaries to Franz Creek in Redwood and Weimar Canyons
retain pools and puddles through summer. Fragments of riparian woodland occur along
Rogers Creek and has been regenerating along Martin Creek following the reduction of
grazing in this area. The moisture-depedent riparian woodland supports a unique
understory of shrubs and herbs.
Based on the 2012 vegetation survey, riparian woodland is not present on the preserve
to the extent that it was classified as a dominant vegetation type. However, given that
there are areas with relatively greater abundance of riparian species, and perhaps
regeneration of historical vegetation, we have retained riparian woodland as a vegetation
community of interest.

8 Pepperwood Flora: Plant Communities
Mixed Chaparral
Mixed chaparral is a scrub community characterized by dense stands of shrubs 3 to 15
feet tall. The shrubs usually grow close together with branches intricately intertwined,
making human passage difficult or impossible. However, deer, pigs, coyotes, gray fox,
wood rats and rabbits move through chaparral with ease. The herbaceous layer is often
depauperate and may be due to dense shrub cover, chemical inhibition, and/or
competition for water (Ornduff et al. 2003). Chaparral at Pepperwood is sometimes
composed of nearly pure stands of manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.) 8 to 15 feet tall. In
other areas the cover is a mix of manzanita, chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum var.
fasciculatum), wedgeleaf ceanothus (Ceanothus cuneatus var. cuneatus), and sticky
monkey flower (Mimulus aurantiacus var. aurantiacus). Chamise and sticky monkey
flower may also form pure stands. Excellent mature chaparral can be seen on the
Manzanita Trail in Garrison Canyon which is a region of the preserve that did not burn in
the 1964 Hanley fire (see the Fire section below for more information).
Mixed chaparral occurs on hot, south-facing slopes, and on hillsides characterized by
impoverished soil such as heavy clay or thin, rocky soil. Mixed chaparral is frequently
the aggregation of woody plants that will first colonize a disturbed area, especially after a
fire, but is often the final seral stage due to edaphic (e.g. poor soil nutrients) and other
restricting environmental conditions (Ornduff et al. 2003). Manzanita seeds are known
for their ability to remain viable through long periods of dormancy. In some instances,
mature stands of chaparral provide a shaded seedbed for its successors: oak woodland
and Douglas-fir forest. Chaparral shrubs, especially chamise, provide excellent deer
browse, and their growth is often retarded by the ―hedging‖ effect of this browsing.
The genus Arctostaphylos (manzanita) exhibits incomplete reproductive barriers
between some species and consequently hybridizes freely. Manzanitas at Pepperwood
may exhibit characteristics of two species, making identification a difficult task in some
instances. The fruits of manzanita are wonderfully sweet and sour and the urn-shaped
flowers provide an abundant nectar source for bumble bees in early January.

Serpentine Chaparral
Serpentine chaparral is an edaphic-based floristic variation on the chaparral theme
due to the toxic qualities of the serpentine soil type. Serpentine chaparral at Pepperwood
is a dense vegetation type composed of shrub species up to 6 feet tall. The dominant
shrubs are leather oak (Quercus durata var. durata), chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum),
and toyon (Heteromeles arbutifolia). The occurrence of serpentine chaparral at
Pepperwood is restricted to the area between the Pepperwood Entrance and the Dwight
Center. Its occurrence throughout Sonoma County is scattered, but frequent with varying
degrees of soil toxicity.

10 Pepperwood Flora: Plant Communities
Grassland
Grassland is a widespread association of annual and perennial herbs, usually without
shrub or tree cover. This community is abundant at Pepperwood and covers more acres
than any other vegetation. Since grassland communities throughout the California Coast
Ranges have historically been intertwined with the presence of people, namely cutting or
burning brush and trees to open areas for agriculture, historical ecologist Arthur Dawson
(2008) conducted a survey of the grasslands at Pepperwood to determine if they were at
one time woodlands or shrublands since the beginning of the historical record in 1858.
Dawson revisited 35 points on the preserve that were originally censused by the General
Land Office between 1858 and 1876. Based on his field observations, and aerial
photographs from 1942 and 2000, Dawson estimated that as of 1858 the preserve
ridgetops were most likely grasslands and that approximately 12% of preserve grasslands
have been lost due to encroachment by woody shrubs and trees. He also noted that the
census records do not document the same prevalence of Douglas-fir or California bay
laurel trees that are currently found at the sample points.
These findings were supported by soil phytolith analyses conducted by Evett and
Bartolome in 2009 and 2010. Phytoliths are small silica bodies produced by plant cells
that can persist in the soil, are often unique identifiers of individual taxa, and are used to
reconstruct historical vegetation communities. Evett and Bartolome sampled soils from
the same 35 points that Dawson surveyed in 2008 and found that most of the grassland
sites were historically grasslands (pre-European settlement). They also found that about
half of the sites currently classified as oak woodlands or savannahs were historically
grasslands, and that there is evidence of recent establishment of Douglas-fir forest into
grassland areas (Evett and Bartolome 2009; Figure 2, Table 2).
A few subdivisions of the grassland plant community can be recognized. Introduced
annual species make up the majority of grasslands on the preserve, however numerous
remnant populations of native grasses persist. Perennial bunch grasses such as Stipa
pulchra, Elymus glaucus subsp. glaucus, and Danthonia californica can dominate
western or northern facing slopes. When grazing by cattle or native mammals is excluded
grasslands may become invaded by shrubs and trees, provided local environmental
conditions support this succession. Wind-dispersed coyote brush (Baccharis pilularis
subsp. consanguinea) and bird-dispersed poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum) are
often the first colonizers, followed by oaks or Douglas-firs. One of the oldest exclosures
illustrating this succession is southeast of the Bechtel House.
Grasslands at Pepperwood support the largest represented genus: Trifolium (clovers).
The preserve boasts a total of 20 taxa, 12 of which are native species. Roots of Trifolium
often contain nodules which harbor nitrogen-fixing bacteria, an essential nutrient addition
to the soil. These plants are important forage for both native grazers and livestock,
inadvertently resulting in the introduction of many non-native species to California
through livestock feed. Despite their small stature, most species are easily recognized
with some experience and effort, and can even be recognizable when dry in summer.
Grasslands within California are still not well classified. Therefore, to improve our
understanding of the mosaic of species that make up the grasslands at Pepperwood,
research scientists began monitoring species composition and abundance across the 
Pepperwood Flora: Plant Communities 11
preserve starting in 2011. Continued long-term monitoring of these systems will allow
scientists to detect potential responses of grassland communities to management
strategies and climate change over time.

community at Pepperwood include:
 Avena (barbata, fatua) Semi-Natural Herbaceous Stands (Wild oats grasslands)

12 Pepperwood Flora: Additional Plant Habitats
Additional Plant Habitats
Rock Outcrops
Rock outcrops, both natural and those exposed by road cuts and quarries, provide a
unique set of environmental conditions for plant growth. Lack of soil development on
rocks makes water and mineral nutrients scarce. A unique group of plants have adapted to
these rigorous conditions and two subgroups can be recognized: those on rocks and road
cuts and those largely restricted to serpentine. Rock outcrops occur sporadically at
Pepperwood. ―Knockers‖ are isolated rocks exposed in meadows or woodlands. The
largest, and perhaps most impressive rocks at Pepperwood, are a group of three huge
knockers along Pepperwood Creek near the McCann Homestead. Knockers are common
along the road from the Barn to Three Tree Hill and beyond. The only cliff rock exposure
is the north slope of Telegraph Hill. Rock-hard redeposited volcanic ash occurs along the
road to Grouse Hill, along Roller Coaster Ridge, and in Rogers Canyon.
Plants characterisitic of rock outcrops at Pepperwood are:
Herbs Shrubs
Aspidotis densa* Arctostaphylos stanfordiana subsp. stanfordiana

Polypodium californicum Pellaea mucronata var. mucronata
Thysanocarpus curvipes
Springs
Pepperwood is home to a number of perennial springs. The continuous water source
in an otherwise seasonally arid environment creates habitat for a unique group of
moisture-dependent or tolerant plants. The perennial springs that occur at Pepperwood
include: Big Spring, Skovie Spring, Rogers Spring, Red Corral Spring, and Leopard Lily
Spring. Various seasonal springs also occur, notably between the Barn and the Bechtel
House.
Plants characteristic of springs at Pepperwood are:
Shrubs Herbs

Marshes
Marshes are areas where the runoff from a spring or drainage spreads out and
saturates the ground, enabling the growth of a particular herbaceous plant assemblage
that is usually dominated by rushes (Juncus spp.) and sedges (Carex spp.). Marshes might
be described as a subdivision of springs because they provide habitat for similar plant
species. Springs are characterized by open water in summer, whereas the water in
marshes percolates through the ground, remaining saturated in sub-surface soils. The four
largest marshes at Pepperwood are at the Goodman Homestead, Rogers Spring, Skovie
Basin, and at the Upper Skovie Marsh.
Plants characteristic of marshes at Pepperwood are:
Shrubs Herbs

Ponds
Pepperwood has a number of artifical and natural ponds that fill with water during
winter rains, then evaporate through the dry season. While most of Pepperwood’s ponds
are ephemeral (dry up every summer), some routinely keep water all year: the largest of
the Double Ponds, Redwood Pond, and Turtle Pond.
Most ponds in lowland California were created by people as water sources for cattle
or horses (Double Ponds, Redwood Pond, above Strebel Homestead) or augmented by
people (Frog Pond). However, Pepperwood is graced with one of the most remarkable
natural ponds in California: Turtle Pond. This feature is the intermediate scarp of a land
slide. It is home to the most successfully reproducing population of Western pond turtles
(Clemmys marmorata) in the area, perhaps in Sonoma County. It is also home to large
numbers of California newts, western toads, Pacific tree frogs, the occasional Pacific 
14 Pepperwood Flora: Additional Plant Habitats
giant salamander, many species of dragonflies and damselflies, and other water-loving
creatures.
The banks of the ponds, the mud exposed as they dry (strand), and the water itself
support a particular flora. Plants characteristic of ponds at Pepperwood are:

Glyceria x occidentalis Triglochin scilloides
Helenium puberulum Veronica peregrina subsp. xalapensis
Vernal Pools
Vernal pools are shallow troughs or depressions which hold water in winter and
spring, and dry up in the summer. This is often because they are underlain with a slowdraining
clay soil. The most obvious vernal pools at Pepperwood occur in the big
landslide west of Three Tree Hill, west of the largest Double Pond, and in the Barn
Meadow.
The characteristic annual plants of vernal pools that occur in the Santa Rosa Valley,
Sonoma Valley, and the Central Valley are largely absent at Pepperwood. Pepperwood’s
larger vernal pools (west of Three Tree Hill and west of Double Pond) seem to be an
unrecognized type of vernal pool dominated by perennials and depauperate in annuals.

Disturbed Areas
Disturbed areas are any lands where the ground has been disturbed or is continually
disturbed. This can be a natural occurrence, such as a landslide or the annual mayhem
visited upon a creek bed by high winter flows. It can also be a disturbance at the hand of
people, such as roads, stables, gardens, homes, and grazed areas. The list of taxa is
extensive and many subdivisions could be recognized. Only one will be discussed here:
creek beds.
Creek beds are of interest because they exhibit characteristics of two habitats:
riparian woodland and disturbed areas. They are also notable for the large number of
plants that occur only in that restricted niche, which is characterized by cyclic disturbance
coupled with summer moisture in an environment otherwise dry in summer.

Homesteads
Historic homesteads are scattered across the preserve. Evidence of former inhabitants
include a standing chimney, foundation blocks, artifacts, and the cultivated taxa that
persist (see Appendix A). When the Pepperwood uplands are grazed and the light is low
at morning or evening, plow lines from pre-Prohibition vineyards can be discerned. One
occasionally finds redwood grape stakes in the grasslands, historical artifacts of previous
lives.

18 Pepperwood Flora: Fire
Fire
The location and seral stage of plant communities at Pepperwood are strongly
influenced by fire. The most recent landscape-altering fire at Pepperwood was the
―Hanley Fire‖ that burned in September 1964. A total of about 52,000 acres burned,
driven by Santa Ana winds (hot, dry, southeast winds). Governor Pat Brown came to
Santa Rosa to declare a State of Emergency; 156 homes and about 150 other structures
burned and the town of Santa Rosa was being evacuated when the fog came in and
enabled the fire to be controlled. Perhaps half of the oak trees at Pepperwood bear scars
from this blaze. Many Douglas-fir trees were killed with some still standing as snags.
Most stands of chaparral were renewed and their age can be safely estimated to date from
1964. The Garrison Canyon did not burn, although there is a bulldozer scar on the ridge
east of the Garrison house from protection efforts. Many madrone and bay stands at
Pepperwood are also stump sprouts initiated after the 1964 fire.
Lightning is rare at Pepperwood, but is an important ignition source. A lightning
strike during an early morning rain storm on September 16, 1989 exploded a tree just
above the cattle gate on the road to the Bechtel House, throwing bark and wood up to 56
meters away. A fire in September 1965 burned the length of the northwestern arm and the
Bald Hills on the neighboring property, ending just north of Martin Creek. A 17-acre
grass fire burned the area around Three Tree Hill on July 4, 1995. About two acres of
serpentine chaparral at the Pepperwood Entrance burned in August 2001.
One of the notable phenomena associated with fire in California is the appearance of
―fire followers,‖ which are annual plants whose seeds lay dormant in the soil for up to 80
years between fires; no fire followers are documented at Pepperwood. The fire followers
Calandrinia breweri and Phacelia suaveolens have each been collected a few hundred
meters east of the Preserve Entrance following a 1996 fire and may reasonably be
expected to occur here.
Suppression of natural fires across California have altered the structure and
composition of oak woodlands, chaparral, grassland, and other communities. The
understories of oak woodland and chaparral communities on the preserve are often thick
with Douglas-fir saplings. The Douglas-fir trees rapidly overtop the canopy layer of oak
woodlands and chaparral, eventually shading out and killing the species beneath.
Encroachment by Douglas-fir trees also increases the amount of woody debris and fuel in
the understory, which can exacerbate the effects of fire. Pepperwood has been removing
Douglas-fir saplings and small trees from oak woodland and chaparral communities since
2006.

Kitchen, on the middle ridge of Redwood Canyon, on the flat south of Weimar
Canyon near Musante’s fenceline, along road to Skovie Basin, ridge between
Redwood Canyon and Weimar Canyon, northeast corner of the preserve. Generally
reproducing only after fires; the Devil’s Kitchen and Bechtel House trees probably
germinated after the 1964 Hanley Fire. The trees are attacked by feral pigs who
girdle them to make sap ooze. The pigs rub in the sap to remove ectoparasites. This
often results in the death of the tree.

[Mar-Aug]
Along Rogers Creek, spring feeding into Pepperwood Creek downstream of the
Bechtel House, Redwood Canyon and Garrison Canyon. The leaves have a spicy
aroma when crushed. The red flowers have numerous spirally arranged petals and
stamens on the rim of a receptacle which becomes a woody urn-shaped fruit that
harbors the one-seeded fruits (achenes).
Lauraceae (Laurel family)
Umbellularia californica (Hook. & Arn.) Nutt. PEPPERWOOD, CALIFORNIA BAY, CALIFORNIA
LAUREL. Evergreen tree. [Nov-May]
Woodland and chaparral, forming pure stands in some places. There is a huge bay
near the High Hill which may be as old as 1,000 years; a bigger one SW of Strebel
Homestead is 20.05 meters in circumference. The fruits of this avocado relative are
perfect miniature avocados, except in flavor. The leaves emerge red, then turn green
as the defensive chemicals that give the leaves their unique odor are produced
(Kepner et. al. 1974). Deer browse red bay leaves, forcing seedlings and saplings
into tightly branched topiary mounds. The flowers are 3-merous; the stamens have
trap-doors to release the pollen, another unusual feature. The dead wood is consumed
by tiny wood-boring beetles of the genus Ips. The frass produced by the beetle larvae

Toxicodendron diversilobum (Torr. & A. Gray) Greene. WESTERN POISON OAK. Deciduous
vine or shrub. [Apr-Jun]
One of our most ecologically tolerant species occurring in grassland, oak woodland,
Douglas-fir forest, chaparral and riparian habitats. Leaves with three leaflets,
becoming bright red in late summer to early fall. Essential oils cause an annoying
dermatitis in some people. Winter stems can be identified by the black sap (look on
broken twigs) and adventitious roots (roots on the stem). The white berries, with
delicate black lines, are an important food for winter resident birds (towhees, juncos,
chicadees, sparrows). 
Pepperwood Flora: Species Accounts 25

[May-Aug]
Found in Turtle Pond, the vernal pools west of Three Tree Hill, and the Double
Ponds vernal pool, where it is locally abundant. The taproot is submerged in winter,
the leaves emerge under water, elongate when the receeding water line exposes the
bank, and the plant flowers on the drying strand, ringing the pond each year with
spiny beauty. Look for three kinds of leaves, the tubular, Eleocharis-like underwater
leaves, the flat strand leaves, and the spiny leaves of the flowering stage. The seeds
are covered in styrofoam-like processes to facilitate floating.
Foeniculum vulgare Mill. FENNEL. Invasive weed (s Eur). Perennial. [May-Sep]
Found at the Ward House Site, below the Manager’s House, and north of the Bechtel
House. The seeds are used as spice and the leaves are good in salad. This is an
alternate host plant of the anise swallowtail butterfly (Papilio zelicaon) and the
spread of fennel in California has precipitated a population increase of this
wonderful insect far beyond its native range and abundance.

Perideridia kelloggii (A. Gray) Mathias. KELLOGG’S YAMPA. Perennial. [Jul-Aug]
Northwest slope of High Hill, Garrison Canyon, Weimar Falls, road near Big Spring.
Native Californians regarded the seeds as an important spice and dug the roots to eat
in the wet season. The flowers bloom after the grassland has dried and are a favorite
haunt of the Pacific ambush bug (Phymata pacifica).
Sanicula bipinnata Hook & Arn. POISON SANICLE. Biennial, perennial. [Apr-May]
Grassland and open oak woodland. Stem leafy, flowers inconspicuous, corolla
yellow..

Inflorescence a panicle with many terminal spheric clusters composed of many 1-4
mm white flowers.
Hedera helix L. ENGLISH IVY. Invasive weed (Eur). Vine. [Aug-Nov]
Skovie Basin. Ivy is one of the most despised wildland weeds in the Pacific
Northwest (cause of the formation of the ―No Ivy League‖), but barely survives at
Pepperwood, presumably due to aridity. The few plants found at the Skovie Basin
were far from known habitation sites and presumably are seedlings resulting from
dispersal by birds.
Asteraceae (Sunflower family)
Achillea millefolium L. YARROW. Perennial. [Apr-Sep]
Grasslands. Yarrow was used in early biosystematic studies in California by Clausen,
Keck and Heisey demonstrating that ecogeographic variability is genetically
controlled, not environmentally induced.

produced in the Central Valley of California is yellow star thistle honey. The young
plant is chemically protected before spines develop. Crush a leaf, then lick your
finger to taste extreme bitter. Keep water handy to rinse your mouth. The flower
heads are protected by spines. The USDA has worked on a biological control, and
released two agents at Pepperwood: a beetle (Bangasternus), and a fly (Fornasari
and Sobhain 1993, Maddox et al. 1986).
Centromadia fitchii (A. Gray) Greene. SPIKEWEED. Annual. [May-Nov]

Fagaceae (Beech family)
Notholithocarpus densiflorus (Hook. & Arn.) Mano et al. var. densiflorus. TAN OAK,
TANBARK OAK. Evergreen tree. [Jun-Oct]
Redwood Canyon where it is locally common, eastern slope of Grouse Hill, Devil’s
Kitchen, and the north slope of the Garrison Canyon Douglas-fir Forest. Tan oak is
very susceptible to the water mold Phytophthora ramorum, the cause of ―sudden oak
death,‖ leading to the death of many trees at Pepperwood. The spiny acorn cap and
erect catkins of Notholithocarpus separates it from the ―true‖ oaks (Quercus). The
staminate catkins of tan oak are erect and strongly aromatic, perfuming the entire
forest in June to attract pollinators, a sharp contrast to the pendant, unscented, wind
pollinated Quercus. Leaves are strongly veined, the lower surface fine, white-woolly.
Acorns mature in two years.
Quercus agrifolia Née var. agrifolia. COAST LIVE OAK. Evergreen tree. [Mar-Apr]
Hot, dry slopes with deep soils. Leaves shiny dark green on the upper surface, thick,

Cool north slopes. Leaves shiny dark green on upper surface, short hairy dull green
on lower. Margins deeply 5-7 lobed without spines. Acorns mature in one year.
Quercus x howellii Tucker (Q. berberidifolia x Q. garryana)
Semideciduous shrub or small tree. This name applies to a wide genetic range of
individuals (Munz and Keck 1958). Some are intermediate between the parents,
others show repeated backcrossing to one or another of the parents. Some are
arborescent and almost totally deciduous like Q. garryana, and some are small
shrubs with mostly evergreen leaves like Q. berberidifolia. Wonderful spreads of
characters can be seen in the hybrid swarms that line E-W trending ridgetops or
canyon bottoms where the parents meet, for instance in the canyon west of the
Garrison House and along the ridge north of there.

Above Rogers Canyon, at Turtle Pond, Hendley Flat, Martin Creek, south of the
Manager’s House. Valley oaks are the most flood-tolerant oak in California and are
often found growing in floodplains. The big valley oaks at Turtle Pond stand with
their lower trunks under water for months at a time each wet season. Leaves obovate,
dark green above, pale below, lobes 6-10 per leave, deep, obtuse. Acorns mature in
one year.

shift to hummingbird pollination probably accompanied invasion of lowlands. The
nature of parasitism in Pedicularis densiflora is of interest in that the main element
gained may be water (Sprague 1962b).

Shrub. [May-Jul]
Chaparral and oak woodland. Leaf upper surface dark green, lower bright green to
yellow, fruits black. The leaves are the food plant of a remarkable caterpillar, the
larva of the pale swallowtail (Papilio eurymedon), which spins a silk sheet on a leaf
to which it returns each dawn after foraging at night. The flowers are galled by an
undescribed gnat of the genus Dasineura that causes the flowers to inflate in a way
that mimics the green fruits.

chamise, but for ten years after fire the newly open stand is alive with an array of
annual and perennial herbs. Chamise is an important browse plant of deer in
California; deer repeatedly browse individual shrubs into 1-2 foot tall topiaries. One
encounters patches of these low deer-browsed chamise bushes among full grown
plants of the same age (6–8 feet tall).

Salicaceae (Willow family)
Populus fremontii S. Watson subsp. fremontii. FREMONT COTTONWOOD. Tree. [Mar-Apr]
Goodman Homestead, Manager’s House. The petiole is swollen into an odd mouthlike
structure by gall-making aphids (Pemphigus populitransversus). This species is
one of the few temperate trees that produces ―canopy roots‖ to recapture nutrients. A
large tree hole caused by a branch fall on the stem of the cottonwood at the
Manager’s House is filled with canopy roots.
Salix laevigata Bebb. RED WILLOW. Tree. [Dec-Jun]
Near streams and ponds, Goodman Homestead.
Salix lasiolepis Benth. ARROYO WILLOW. Small tree. [Jan-Jun]
Streambanks, Martin Creek.
Sapindaceae (Soapberry family)
Acer macrophyllum Pursh. BIG-LEAF MAPLE. Deciduous tree. [Mar-Jun]
Douglas-fir forest and along streams, less frequent in oak woodland. The biggest
maples at Pepperwood are on hill slopes, presumably near springs. A magnificent
one is just west of the McCann Homestead, another is on the ridge between Martin
Creek and Fern Canyon (3.22 m circumference). The leaves are attacked in August 
Pepperwood Flora: Species Accounts 61
and September by a fungus (Rhytisma punctatum) that causes conspicuous dimesized
discolorations. When maples withdraw resources from their leaves, the leaves
turn yellow and fall from the tree. The fungus spots remain green. Consequently,
when the leaves land in creeks caddisfly larvae scrape (eat) the nutrient-rich, fungusinfested
part first.
Aesculus californica (Spach) Nutt. CALIFORNIA BUCKEYE. Deciduous tree. [May-Jun]
Oak woodland, frequent in chaparral. Leaves palmately compound, inflorescence an
upright panicle, petals white to pink. The buckeye produces by far our largest seed.
The seed provided a famine food for native Californians, but required extensive
leaching as it is toxic enough to use as a fish poison. The flower nectar is toxic to
introduced honey bees, but apparently not so to native bumble bees. The flowers are
functionally monoecious, with flowers low on the panicle having sterile ovaries, and
those near the tip being functionally female. This is the tree that seems to most
perfectly mirror our Mediterranean climate, leafing out early (February, March) and
losing its leaves as the dry season reaches its peak (June, July). The branches are
often covered by an orange crustose lichen (Caloplaca cerina).

Often dominating ungrazed, grassy slopes. Less conspicuous when grazed. Included
in the seed mix recommended by the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) after the 1964
Hanley fire. Although this taxon is not labeled as ―noxious weed‖ in the Jepson
Manual, it is certainly noxious in the Pepperwood grasslands.

74 Pepperwood Flora: Appendix A, Cultivated Taxa
Appendix A: Cultivated Taxa
Acer negundo L. BOX ELDER. Tree. [Mar-Apr]
Deciduous tree planted in the Garrison Canyon in 1976 by D. Cavagnaro and G. de
Nevers.
Agave americana L. CENTURY PLANT. (Mex). Perennial.
Cultivated at the McCann and Strebel Homesteads, and has escaped to the top of
Telegraph Hill, road cut below Ward House Site. The spectacular inflorescences are
produced only once in the life of each rosette, after about 25 years. Bat-pollinated in
Mexico, perhaps facultatively pollinated by hummingbirds and bumble bees here.
Amaryllis belladonna L. NAKED LADIES. (s Amer, Afr, Medit). Perennial. [Jul-Sep]
Bulb with wonderfully fragrant pink flowers. Goodman, McCann, and Strebel
Homesteads; Garrison Canyon. Native to Japan. Naked lilies are one of a group of
geophytes (bulbs) that put up leaves in the wet season, then bloom without leaves in
the middle of the dry season. The phenomenon is best know from the Negev Desert
of Israel, and South Africa. It may be that these plants bloom ―out of season‖ to
avoid competition for pollinators. Our best native plant example of this phenomenon
is Brodiaea leptandra.
Carya illinoinensis (Wangenh.) K. Koch. PECAN. ( ). Tree. [Apr-May]
Manager’s House. This beautiful, mature tree fruits every year, but the nuts don’t
develop to maturity and are inedible.
Citrus x sinensis (L.) Osbeck. SWEET ORANGE. ( ). Tree. [ ]
The orange tree along the road between Goodman Homestead and the Turtle Pond
survived ups and downs over perhaps 100 years: snow every 4 or 5 years, dying back
from frostbite, then gradually recovering. The fruits were small, juicy and delicious.
It finally succumbed to a grass fire in 1996.
Cydonia oblonga Mill. QUINCE. ( ). Tree. [ ]
The last of the old quince bushes at the McCann Homestead died in 1991.
Diospyros kaki L. f. JAPANESE PERSIMMON. (Asia). Tree. [ ]
The Hachia variety persimmon tree fruits most years near the old winery foundation
at the Strebel Homestead.
Diospyros lotus L. DATE PLUM. (se Asia, sw Eur). Tree. [Jun-Jul]
Manager’s House. This is probably a tree developed from rootstock that grew up
after the grafted top died.
Eucalyptus globulus Labill. BLUE GUM. Invasive weed (se Australia). Tree. [Oct-Jan]
Old trees at Strebel Homestead. Apparently it is too dry at Pepperwood for this tree
to reproduce by seed, althought it produces abundant seed. This is an interesting
contrast to the coastal situation just 20 miles west, where it is an invasive weed.
Ficus carica L. FIG. Invasive weed (sw Asia). Tree. [Mar-Apr]
Manager’s House; McCann, Goodman, and Strebel Homesteads; west of the Bechtel
House; Martin Creek. One of the highlights of a visit to Pepperwood is climbing in 
Pepperwood Flora: Appendix A, Cultivated Taxa 75
the acre-large old Black Mission figs at the Goodman Homestead. When ripe the figs
are unrivaled, coyotes, foxes, and bear eat the fruits and distribute the seeds all over
the preserve. Seedlings are relatively common, but usually short-lived. Foxes are
good tree climbers and are apparently responsible for eipiphytic fig seedlings in tree
crotches.
Hesperocyparis macrocarpa (Hartw.) Bartel. MONTEREY CYPRESS. (Monterey Peninsula,
Point Lobos). CNPS Rank 1B.2. Tree.
A few beautiful, old, flattopped trees planted for shade at the McCann Homestead
survive at the Red Corral. Planted at homestead sites. They are a favorite perch of
crows, ravens and raptors. Rare plant, native only in Monterey County, California.
Juglans regia L. ENGLISH WALNUT. (Eurasia). Tree. [ ]
Manager’s House, Garrison Canyon, above Strebel Homestead. The husk is attacked
by walnut husk flies (Rhagoletis completa) that turn it to an inky black ooze which is
a remarkably effective dye. California black walnut (Juglans nigra) is used as a root
stock to graft English walnut on. The black walnut is more vigorous and produces a
fatter stem with black bark which contrasts sharply with the white stem of the
English walnut above after a few years. When the English walnut top dies the black
walnut then grows up as a tree, as at Goodman Homestead and above Strebel
Homestead.
Kniphofia uvaria (L.) Oken. POKER PLANT. (s Afr). Perennial. [Apr-Jul]
Infrequent, a garden escape from Rogers Canyon (Best et al. 1996). It persists from
cultivation at the McCann and Goodman Homesteads.
Leucojum aestivum L. SNOWFLAKE. (Eur). Perennial. [Apr-May]
Persisting at Goodman Homestead.
Malus pumila Mill. APPLE. (Eurasia). Tree. [Apr-May]
Rogers, Goodman Homestead, Garrison Canyon, escaped near Manager’s House,
Strebel Homestead. From Europe. The apples are one of the great delights of
Pepperwood, both at blooming time and during harvest. One year a black bear
harvested all the branches from a few of the trees at the Rogers Orchard, ate all the
apples, and left a great mound of scat to tell the tale.
Narcissus pseudonarcissus L. DAFFODIL. (Eur, w Asia, n Afr). Perennial. [spring]
Strebel Homestead.
Populus nigra L. LOMBARDY POPLAR. (Eur). Tree. [Feb-May]
Old specimen trees at Strebel Homestead.
Prunus spp. UPPER ORCHARD PLUM, GOODMAN PLUM. ( ). Tree. [ ]
Goodman Homestead. A seed planted during the homestead era has produced a small
group of root suckering trees just downstream of the cottonwood at Goodman
Homestead.
Prunus avium (L.) L. SWEET CHERRY. ( ). Tree. [ ]
Strebel and McCann Homesteads.
Prunus armeniaca L. APRICOT. (China). Tree. [ ]
Goodman Homestead, above Strebel Homestead.
76 Pepperwood Flora: Appendix A, Cultivated Taxa
Prunus avium (L.) L. CHERRY. (Eurasia). Tree. [ ]
Above Strebel Homestead, McCann Homestead.
Prunus cerasifera Ehrh. CHERRY PLUM. Invasive weed (se Eur). Tree. [Feb-Mar]
McCann Homestead, gravel pit by the Red Corral, Manager’s House, Garrison
Canyon.
Prunus domestica L. COMMON PLUM. (sw Asia). Tree. [ ]
Goodman and Strebel Homesteads, Garrison Canyon.
Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A. Webb. ALMOND. (w Asia, n Afr). Tree. [Feb-Mar]
The last surviving homestead almonds, at the Manager’s House and McCann
Homestead, died in 1995.
Prunus persica (L.) Batsch. PEACH. (e Asia). Tree. [Mar]
The last peach at McCann Homestead died in 1993.
Pyrus communis L. COMMON PEAR. (Eurasia). Tree. [Feb-Apr]
McCann and Goodman Homesteads, above Strebel Homestead. There are eight or
ten pear trees along the creek below the main spring in the 40 acre pasture west of
the Manager’s House. They don’t appear planted and may be escapees from
cultivation.
